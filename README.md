# webp-fallback

Using WebP while supporting browsers that don't currently support it requires you to use `<picture>` tag.
It is a lot more verbose than just typing a single line of `<img>` and so might discourage you from using WebP at all due to poor Dev UX.

This extension will allow you to:

## Create a \<picture> tag from your given src

  ![Create a <picture> tag from your given src](/webp-1.gif)


## Create a <picture> tag from an existing \<img> tag

![Create a <picture> tag from an existing <img> tag](/webp-2.gif)
